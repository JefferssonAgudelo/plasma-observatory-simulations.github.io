The Working Group
-----------------

The working group members and contributors represent a diverse sampling of numerical models of geospace plasmas, ranging from global to local and fluid to fully-kinetic models. This provides the full range of scales needed to assess the cross-scale phenomena in the Earth's magnetosphere and targeted by Plasma Observatory.

Vlasiator
^^^^^^^^^

Vlasiator is a 6D ion-kinetic hybrid-Vlasov model for the Earth's global magnetosphere. Vlasiator simulates the dynamics of plasma using a hybrid-Vlasov model, where protons are described by their distribution function f(r,v,t) in ordinary (r) and velocity (v) space, and electrons are a charge-neutralising fluid. This approach neglects electron kinetic effects but retains ion kinetics. The time-evolution of f(r,v,t) is given by Vlasov's equation, which is coupled self-consistently to Maxwell's equations giving the evolution of the electric and magnetic fields E and B. Maxwell's equations neglect the displacement current. The equations are closed by a generalised Ohm's law including the Hall term.

*muphyII* plasma simulation framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *muphyII* code is a simulation framework for collisionless plasma physics and targeted at space plasmas in particular. The *muphyII* code utilizes a hierarchy of models with different inherent scales to address the separation of scales problem typically encountered in these plasmas. It allows stand-alone use of models as well as a model-based dynamic and adaptive domain decomposition and resorts to novel techniques for energy conservation, careful treatment of inner-domain model boundaries for interface coupling, and robust time stepping algorithms.

Capabilities
------------

Here we could start listing examples on what we can do and have done, and which models to look at for which sorts of phenomena. 

Fast turnaround data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could describe which sorts of data we can provide quickly

Medium turnaround projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could describe things we might be doing in near-future, but that require planning and/or new simulation runs or resources.

Slow turnaround projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could list things that require significant new effort, e.g. new simulation runs with significant HPC resources that need to be acquired.
