   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This website will serve as a collection of material, tools, and references for the Numerical Simulations Working Group of the `Plasma Observatory <https://plasma-observatory.inaf.it/>`_ ESA M7 candidate mission --- a Users' Guide to the Working Group, of sorts. Our task is to support the mission proposal with plasma simulations, providing virtual spacecraft observations to assess science impact, help with mission and measurement design, and to generate nice science along the way!

This page should contain mostly overviews on topics, and the branch off to subpages.

The Working Group
-----------------

The working group members and contributors represent a diverse sampling of numerical models of geospace plasmas, ranging from global to local and fluid to fully-kinetic models. This provides the full range of scales needed to assess the cross-scale phenomena in the Earth's magnetosphere and targeted by Plasma Observatory.

Members & Contributors

Maybe we list soon our members here?

Models

Maybe we list soon our associated models here, with few words and a link to a specific page?

Capabilities
------------

Here we could start listing examples on what we can do and have done, and which models to look at for which sorts of phenomena. 

Fast turnaround data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could describe which sorts of data we can provide quickly

Medium turnaround projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could describe things we might be doing in near-future, but that require planning and/or new simulation runs or resources.

Slow turnaround projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could list things that require significant new effort, e.g. new simulation runs with significant HPC resources that need to be acquired.
