   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This website will serve as a collection of material, tools, and references for the Numerical Simulations Working Group of the `Plasma Observatory <https://plasma-observatory.inaf.it/>`_ ESA M7 candidate mission --- a Users' Guide to the Working Group, of sorts. Our task is to support the mission proposal with plasma simulations, providing virtual spacecraft observations to assess science impact, help with mission and measurement design, and to generate nice science along the way!

This page should contain mostly overviews on topics, and the branch off to subpages.
